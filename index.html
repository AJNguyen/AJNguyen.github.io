								<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
								<p>My interest in IT is creating programs and applications. This started when I saw some videos of developers talking about their ideas and how they made them come to life in a sense. The thought of creating what you think off the top if your head and making it work sounds like an awesome idea. My first experience of creating stuff were through scratch programs and unity software.<br />
									<br />
								I chose to come and study at RMIT cause my school had a partnership with them through the SNAP program, which allowed me to have an easier time getting into a course of my choosing. RMIT is also known for being good for technology driven courses.<br />
									<br />
								 I’m hoping to gain skills and knowledge on programming and software development so that I can create and design applications and programs of my ideas. I also hope to gain a wider range of experience with computer hardware and software.</p>

								<h2>Myer-Briggs Personality Test<br />
								Result: The Advocate (INFJ-T)</h2>
								<p>The results of the Myer-Briggs personality test don’t really mean much to me as they are just vague statements that can apply to anyone given the correct situation or certain situation. There is also no certainty that results are accurate due to people changing their answers depending on their current mood or deciding on an ideal answer. The results won’t influence my behaviour on any team as I will continue doing what I do in group assignment, which is work together to achieve the most optimal result. Using the test to form teams won’t really achieve much as it will depend entirely on how much people are willing to participate on the work.</p>

								<h2>Online Learning Style Test <br />
								Result: Visual Learner</h2>
								<p>Just like the Myer-Briggs test, the learning style test result don’t really mean much to me as I too see them as vague statements that can be applied to any users given the correct circumstances. However, the results of the test can be interesting when understanding how to help team members understand different type of problems. The result will allow me to see the best approach to help someone to understand how to complete a task, via visual, sounding or mixture of both..</p>

								<h2>DISC Personality Test <br />
								Result: Steadiness</h2>
								<p>The DISC personality test shows what type of behaviour they have towards others and everyday things. My results state that I’m steady and like the other tests, this doesn’t really mean much to me. This isn’t going to influence on how I act with my team, I’m going to put in the work and I’m going to do what I can to complete a task. The results of this test won’t be considered when I be forming a team.</p>

									<br />
								Junior Web Developer/Programmer assist senior developers on complex applications and assignments through the four process of analysis, coding, testing and documentations and if needed research. This position seems like the most ideal starting job that can help teach me how the work environment of these sort of jobs work, as well as get more experience workers to teach me new techniques and skills. <br />
									<br />
								 This position needs experience in .NET + SQL + HTML as well as back end development and prototyping and domain registration. Most of these are database creation and such which I only have the basic knowledge of using and creating database programs. I’m hoping to learn how to create these through the RMIT course of Bachelor of Information Technology so that I can become qualified to apply to this starting position.</p>

								<h2>Project Idea<br />
								Overview</h2>
								<p>My project idea is to create an immersive virtual reality game that encompasses around motion capture control and movement. The game could be made through Unity engine as they can supply the most basic tools and technologies for a user to create a virtual reality game. The game will be something simple sounding such as controlling elements such as fire or water in the user’s hands using the controllers, where they can then shoot at enemies or destructible objects.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
									<h3>Motivation</h3>
									<p>The project will be interesting cause it’s virtual reality and virtual reality is just awesome in general. Virtual reality is futuristic technology that has been dreamt of for many decades, with its first concept being made in 1957 by inventor Morton Heilig. And here we have it in our world today. The possibility to create and advance what we can do with it is indeed limitless. And the genre of virtual reality gaming is the future of gaming for decades to come.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-laptop">
									<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
									<p>The virtual reality game can be created through the unity engine as it provides many tools and technologies to create an immersive 3d world as well as be able to implement virtual reality software into it. A VR headset, VR sensor and pair of VR controllers will be needed such as an oculus rift or a PlayStation VR set, so that the game can be tested and see if it’s playable. Steam VR would also be needed to allow the unity program to run a VR game through an oculus.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Description</h3>
									<p>Augue consectetur sed interdum imperdiet et ipsum. Mauris lorem tincidunt nullam amet leo Aenean ligula consequat consequat.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>Skills Required</h3>
									<p>A basic knowledge of the unity engine, such as the world building functions and features will be needed to create this project. Knowledge on how the VR headset works as well as a set of VR devices including headset, controllers and sensors. These skills won’t be hard to learn and would be take a day or so to learn and get use to. The hardware although pricey, are easily obtainable through any electronic stores.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<p>In end outcome of the project will be either a complete game or a basic demo that allows the user to look around a world and summon and control elements such as fire, water, lightning, etc. This project would just be a fun game that might be able to highlights the many potential of VR while also being enjoyable.  </p>
